# BLIB is a standard library and not only for Bat files

it is not yet available, so this will be added in the future.

if you write any library you can send it to the CMDC author -
and there is a possibility that it will be added.

libraries should be of two options:
if you write everything in one file,
then you need to put it in the root of the BLIB folder.
If the library consists of many files,
then you should simply save everything in a separate folder -
which you will call the name of the library.

## For example

    BLIB \  
    ----- exceptions.hbat  
    ----- types \  
    ----- ----- int.hbat  
    ----- ----- float.hbat  

These are just examples of these libraries do not exist at the moment.
